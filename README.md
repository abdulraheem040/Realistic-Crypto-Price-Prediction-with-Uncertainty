After diving deep into financial ML, I've developed a sophisticated crypto prediction system that goes beyond simple price forecasting. Here's what makes it special:
🎯 Key Features:
🧠 Advanced Deep Learning Architecture:

Bidirectional LSTM with multi-head attention
Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation
Residual connections to prevent vanishing gradients

📊 Smart Feature Engineering:

20+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
Normalized ratios instead of absolute prices
Volatility, momentum, and trend strength features
RobustScaler for better outlier handling

⚡ Real-Time Intelligence:

Live predictions with 95% confidence intervals
Risk assessment and market regime detection
Smart trading signals (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral)
Interactive visualizations with Plotly

🛡️ Built for Real Trading:

Predicts returns (not absolute prices) for stability
HuberLoss for outlier robustness
Early stopping to prevent overfitting
Output capped at ±10% for realistic predictions

🔮 What It Delivers:
✅ Next 10-period price predictions with confidence bands
✅ Uncertainty quantification for risk management
✅ Real-time technical analysis
✅ Market volatility regime detection
✅ Performance metrics and model validation
The model doesn't just predict—it tells you HOW confident it is in each prediction. This is crucial for risk management in volatile crypto markets!
Built with Python, PyTorch, Streamlit, and integrated with Binance API for live data.
What's your experience with ML in trading? Have you experimented with uncertainty quantification in financial models?
